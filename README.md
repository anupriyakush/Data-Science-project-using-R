# Data-Science-model selection project-using-R
This is a model selection project where I created five models and analysed their p-value, t-value, R squared, BIC and plots. These models include simple linear regression, multivariate model, transformed model, model based on best correlation (two models on this).


•	Cleaned and visualized data using scatterplot and histogram in RStudio and calculated the correlation
•	Built simple and multiple linear regression models and performed hypothesis testing
•	Obtained interval estimation and made predictions for 3 different scenarios
